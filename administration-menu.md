**phpSysInfo** is a customizable PHP script that displays very nicely information about your system.  
The script comes from: [https://github.com/phpsysinfo/phpsysinfo](https://github.com/phpsysinfo/phpsysinfo), and is constantly updated!

**PhpSecInfo** provides an equivalent to the phpinfo\(\) function that reports security information about the PHP environment, and offers suggestions for improvement. The script comes from [https://github.com/funkatron/phpsecinfo](https://github.com/funkatron/phpsecinfo), but unfortunately, it was not updated for many years, so the information is definitely outdated. Slighty newer version is on: [https://github.com/robocoder/phpsecinfo](https://github.com/robocoder/phpsecinfo)
